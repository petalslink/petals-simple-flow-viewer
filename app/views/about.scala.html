    	<p class="page-left">This application allows to visualize Petals exchanges or flows.</p>

    		Information is extracted and combined from log files generated by Petals.
    		These files require a specific configuration, and more precisely, the MONIT log level must be activated.
    	</p>
		<p class="page-left with-bottom">Thus, this application also illustrates the possibilities offered by the Petals logs.</p>
